## 1. Project Overview
Purpose: The Enhanced Keylogger helps you monitor and analyze keyboard, mouse, clipboard, window focus, screenshots, USB events, and performance data on authorized systems, with strong security and privacy controls. It is designed for legitimate use cases such as usability testing, parental control, endpoint monitoring within your organization, and academic/security research where you have explicit permission.

Objectives:
- Provide comprehensive, configurable input and activity monitoring
- Preserve privacy via sanitization, hashing, and application exclusions
- Ensure security with encryption and access control
- Offer a web interface and tools for real-time monitoring and post-hoc analysis
- Maintain reliable performance with buffering, rotation, and resource tracking

Target audience and use cases:
- Security analysts and researchers evaluating user behavior or system usage patterns
- IT administrators monitoring corporate endpoints with consent and policy
- Parents or guardians monitoring family devices with consent
- QA/usability teams capturing interaction data during tests

## 2. Technical Specifications
System architecture and components:
- Core services orchestrate configuration, encryption, logging, and the main keylogger runtime.
- Listeners capture inputs/events: keyboard, mouse, and clipboard under listeners/.
- Utilities monitor environment: window focus/usage, screenshots, USB device changes, and performance under utils/.
- Web interface built with Flask for dashboard, logs, configuration, export, and performance views under web/ with templates/ and static/ assets.
- Parsers provide log parsing and export for analysis under parsers/.

Key modules and responsibilities (non-exhaustive):
- core.config_manager: load, validate, and provide configuration values
- core.encryption_manager: manage encryption keys and AES-256-GCM operations
- core.logging_manager: buffered, encrypted log writing with rotation
- core.keylogger: orchestrates listeners, lifecycle, and exports
- listeners.keyboard_listener: keystroke capture, sensitive data filtering, shortcut detection
- listeners.mouse_listener: click, movement, scroll tracking
- listeners.clipboard_listener: clipboard polling with size and privacy limits
- utils.window_monitor: active window tracking and usage timing (Windows-focused)
- utils.screenshot_monitor: periodic screenshots with blur/redaction and compression
- utils.usb_monitor: USB connect/disconnect detection and device details
- utils.performance_monitor: CPU/memory/disk/network plus keylogger metrics
- web.app: Flask routes for login, dashboard, logs, config, export, performance
- parsers.log_parser: parsing, statistics, and export to text/CSV/JSON

Dependencies and requirements:
- Python 3.8+ with pip
- See ‚ÄúRequirements‚Äù for the full dependency list and versions
- Windows-specific functionality (active window and some USB details) requires pywin32

Technical constraints and considerations:
- Platform differences: active window and some USB metadata collection are Windows-oriented; on other OSes, these features may be reduced or disabled
- Permissions: some environments require elevated privileges to capture inputs or access system APIs
- Privacy and compliance: configure exclusions, sanitization, and encryption according to your policies and local laws
- Performance: screenshots and high-frequency polling can be resource intensive; adjust intervals and buffer sizes via config.json

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Quick Setup (recommended)
```bash
python setup.py
```
This will:
- Check Python version
- Create required directories (keys, logs, screenshots, core, listeners, utils, parsers, web, tests)
- Install dependencies from requirements.txt
- Generate a default config.json
- Generate an encryption key at keys/encryption.key
- Run basic tests and optionally configure autostart

If you prefer manual setup, follow the steps below.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd keylogger
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initial Configuration
- If config.json does not exist, run the setup script above (python setup.py) to create one with sensible defaults.
- Update credentials and secrets:
  - web.admin_username and web.admin_password for the web interface login
  - web.secret_key to a strong random value
- Review privacy, performance, and feature toggles according to your needs.

### 4. Generate Encryption Key
```bash
python -c "from core.encryption_manager import EncryptionManager; EncryptionManager('keys/encryption.key')"
```
This will initialize and persist a secure key at keys/encryption.key if it does not already exist.

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Start keylogger in interactive mode
python main.py

# Start with web interface
python main.py --web-only

# Run as daemon (background)
python main.py --daemon

# Parse existing log files
python main.py --parse path/to/logfile.txt
```

### CLI Reference
- -c, --config PATH: Configuration file path (default: config.json)
- -w, --web-only: Run web interface only
- -d, --daemon: Run as daemon (background)
- --parse FILE: Parse an existing log file instead of running the keylogger
- -o, --output FILE: Output file when parsing (default varies by format)
- -f, --format {text,csv,json}: Output format when parsing (default: text)
- --version: Show version and exit

### Web Interface
1. Start with web interface: `python main.py --web-only`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Login with configured credentials
4. Monitor real-time activity and manage settings

Note: The web interface credentials are read from config.json at web.admin_username and web.admin_password. Older configs using web.username and web.password are automatically migrated to the new keys on the next run; you can also rename them manually if desired.

### Interactive Commands
When running in interactive mode, use these commands:
- `status` - Show current keylogger status
- `stats` - Display statistics
- `export <format> <file>` - Export logs (json/csv/txt)
- `config` - Reload configuration
- `stop` - Stop keylogger
- `quit` - Quit application
- `help` - Show available commands
